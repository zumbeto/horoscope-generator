# Astrology Message Generator

**Astrology Message Generator** is a simple JavaScript program that outputs a random astrology-themed message every time it's run. The message is composed of three parts: a zodiac sign, an astrological event, and a prediction. The program was created for a Codecademy portfolio project.

## Structure

The program is made up of three main components:

- An object (astrologyData) containing arrays of potential message components.
- A helper function (getRandomIndex()) to select a random element from these arrays.
- The main function (generateAstrologyMessage()), which constructs the final message.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory containing astrologyMessageGenerator.js.
3. Run the file in a JavaScript environment (such as Node.js) with the command:

> `node astrologyMessageGenerator.js`

You will see a random astrology message printed to the console.

## Example Output

> Zodiac Sign: Aries  
> Astrological Event: Moon Phase: New Moon  
> Prediction: Your dreams are more reachable than they seem.

Enjoy the program and may the stars be in your favor!
